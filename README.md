# AudioStorageAndRecognition
Simple audio storage and recognition tool.

This is a simple audio storage and recognition tool which makes use of the Python libraries of numpy, scipy and sqlite3 to analyse and store .wav files and recognize snippets from them. The tkinter library is used to make the user interface for the program.

The songs currently stored in the database are just 10 second snippets of the complete song, used only to demonstrate the functionality of the program. Full songs can later be added, although they would increase the recognition time considerably.

The folder 'Test Songs' contains snippets of songs which can be tested for using the application.'

Run 'SongDatabaseGUI.py' to open the database functionality of the program.
Run 'SongDetectionGUI.py' to open the recognition functionality of the program.
